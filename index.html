                                 “As of today, metformin-based drugs are the basis of
                                 practically all treatment methods. However, this is a
                                 delusion shared by illiterate patients and doctors.
                                 Metformin is a straight path to illness and untimely
                                 death. This isn’t treatment. If you come to your doctor
                                 with type 2 diabetes and he prescribes treatment based on
                                 these drugs, run away from such a doctor immediately.
                              </p>

                                 All of these drugs increase blood insulin to critical
                                 levels. With this amount of insulin, the blood becomes
                                 thick, like condensed milk. In large quantities, insulin
                                 causes colossal harm to the body. It literally destroys
                                 the liver, kidneys and other excretory organs. Insulin is
                                 similar in consistency and action to stomach acid. Imagine
                                 what would happen if stomach acid filled your internal
                                 organs. It would burn right through them!

                                 Elevated insulin levels corrode cells, thereby
                                 contributing to their abnormal division, and this is
                                 already nothing less than oncology. For this reason,
                                 CANCER DEVELOPS IN 28% OF DIABETICS, as statistics show.

                                 Plus, it is the high insulin content that leads to the
                                 rapid clogging of blood vessels with cholesterol plaques,
                                 since insulin-rich blood becomes thick and starts moving
                                 slower. As a result, blood vessels become clogged with
                                 cholesterol plaques, which in turn leads to pressure
                                 surges. Hypertension accompanies 98% of diabetics. Many

                                 say they couldn’t care less. They just do their job and
                                 get paid for it. They don't care if you get well or not.
                                 That’s why without a second thought they prescribe
                                 whatever their superiors or the Ministry tell them to. And
                                 what they’re told to prescribe are metformin-based drugs,
                                 since their sale brings good profits. And it also provides
                                 an effect, albeit a temporary one.

                                    diabetes, but still somehow I couldn’t believe it until
                                    the end - after all, everyone says that it cannot be
                                    cured, that I’ll just be wasting my time. That’s why I
                                    didn’t go in person. But then I saw you on TV and
                                    decided to call you.

                                    have passed since that moment and I am still alive. And

                                    feel it. In the past 10 years I have not felt as healthy
                                    and free of diabetes as I feel now! I began to sleep
                                    well, the feeling of unquenchable thirst disappeared, I
                                    stopped going to the toilet so often, the fatigue and
                                    constant weakness also disappeared without a trace. The
                                    pressure surges stopped. My eyesight improved. I haven’t
                                    completed my treatment yet, but I am sure that I will
                                    win this battle. Thank you so much for Celsium Glyco Optimizer Blood Sugar."

                                 The main effect of
                                 <a href="{offer_link}">Celsium Glyco Optimizer Blood Sugar</a>
                                 is that it not only removes sugar from the blood and thus
                                 normalizes glucose levels. It also dissolves sugar, which
                                 has already penetrated the walls of blood vessels thanks
                                 to one of its ingredients - Ginkgo Biloba. It’s sort of
                                 like the blood vessel walls are thawed out and regain the
                                 ability to narrow and stretch. The blood clots get
                                 dissolved, the vessels are cleansed. Small capillaries are
                                 restored. As a result, the person's pressure stops
                                 spiking, the weakness and drowsiness disappear, and wounds
                                 and cuts start to heal faster. In addition, the person
                                 just gets more energy. They immediately get the urge to do
                                 something around the house or in the garden.

                                 does not raise insulin levels, so it is harmless. But in
                                 addition to that it also has a positive effect - namely,
                                 it reduces insulin resistance. This is a very remarkable
                                 property. The biologically active components of the drug
                                 penetrate directly into the cells of muscles, fat and
                                 liver and stimulate them in such a way that they begin to
                                 better respond to the presence of the hormone in the
                                 bloodstream. In medicine, this process is called
                                 "secondary cell education." As a result, over time, the
                                 cells begin to consume glucose more actively, which leads
                                 to a decrease in its concentration in the blood. This is
                                 the safest way for the body to utilize glucose.

                                 in pharmacies. This drug is rarely available. Is that
                                 true? And what advice would you give to American

                                 - Yes, it is. Celsium Glyco Optimizer Blood Sugar is produced
                                 in small limited quantities, and therefore it simply does
                                 not reach pharmacies. Most of the batch is sold abroad,
                                 another part is bought by private clinics.

                                          Oh, I went through so much because of my diabetes
                                          before I found out about
                                          <a href="{offer_link}">Celsium Glyco Optimizer Blood Sugar</a>.
                                          My life was exactly like the poor woman’s in the
                                          story. Besides high sugar levels I also had very
                                          high blood pressure (200-230), which is why I would
                                          throw up constantly. Plus I was overweight – 120 kg
                                          (I’m pretty short). Edema, shortness of breath - I
                                          went through all of that. My body was rotting and
                                          often festering. But not anymore. I underwent a
                                          course treatment with
                                          <a href="{offer_link}">Celsium Glyco Optimizer Blood Sugar</a>.
                                          Now at least I feel like a living person. I lost
                                          weight, the pressure stopped spiking. Basically,
                                          everything is fine now, I wish everyone the same.

                                          Hey everyone. I am 59 years old, I used to weigh 124
                                          kg, now – only 80 kg, my height is 168 cm. My

                                          even 29. Now - 5.0. I took

                                          changes. I measure my blood sugar levels several

                                          Diabetes is a very insidious disease. I’ve had it
                                          for 4 years now, there were no external
                                          manifestations, only my mouth was sometimes dry. So,
                                          I wasn’t really worried about amputated legs and
                                          such. But recently I fainted. I was taken to the
                                          hospital, where I was tested. Everything turned out
                                          to be very serious. My kidneys were in a
                                          precancerous state, my blood vessels were so worn
                                          out that the doctors couldn’t believe it. This is
                                          what happens when the disease isn’t treated in time.

                                          with diabetes. She is only 7 years old. We didn’t

                                          young age. We consulted with many endocrinologists.
                                          Decided to try
